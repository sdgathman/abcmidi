This repo is yet another mirror on github tracking changes with each
release from the maintainer.  The other mirrors lost interest and stopped tracking.  I can see
that checking for updates will need to be automated.  Maybe the maintainer can be convinced to 
use a public git repo - or export a private one read only.
